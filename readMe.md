# Tyrbal: A Futuristic Hybrid Programming Language üöÄ

Welcome to **Tyrbal**, a cutting-edge programming language designed to bridge the gap between functional elegance and systems-level performance. Named after its creators, **Tyron** and **Baldur**, Tyrbal combines the best of both worlds, offering a seamless blend of paradigms for modern, multi-domain development. Whether you're building low-level hardware applications or scalable distributed systems, Tyrbal has you covered.

## üåü Key Features

### 1. **Dynamic Paradigm Switching**

Tyrbal allows developers to switch between **functional** and **imperative** programming styles effortlessly. Define modules in a pure, immutable functional style or a stateful, mutable imperative style‚ÄîTyrbal optimizes across paradigms during compilation.

```tyrbal
// Functional module
module Calc [functional]
  sum = (a, b) => a + b
  factorial = n => n == 0 ? 1 : n * factorial(n - 1)
end

// Imperative module
module Sort [imperative]
  function bubbleSort(arr):
    for i in 0...arr.length - 1:
      for j in 0...(arr.length - i - 1):
        if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
          swap(arr[j], arr[j + 1])
end
```

---

### 2. **Runic Syntax**

For the hardcore enthusiasts, Tyrbal offers a **runic syntax** inspired by Norse runes. Write code in a standard human-readable format or use symbolic runes for compact, cryptic scripts. Perfect for fun, security, or stylistic flair!

```tyrbal
// In runic mode
·ö¶ x, y => x + y; // Equivalent to x, y => x + y
```

### 3. **The Bifr√∂st Compiler**

Named after the mythical bridge between realms, the **Bifr√∂st Compiler** transpiles Tyrbal code into multiple target languages, including **C**, **Rust**, **Python**, and **WebAssembly**. Build applications that work seamlessly across ecosystems.

---

### 4. **Threading and Concurrency as First-Class Concepts**

Tyrbal embraces the structured chaos of Viking raids with **Baldur Threads** (synchronized threads) and **Tyron Streams** (asynchronous streams). These are natively integrated into the language syntax.

```tyrbal
thread do:
  print("This runs in parallel!")
end

stream myStream => fetchData().filter(x => x > 10)
```

---

### 5. **Self-Healing Code**

Inspired by the resilience of Norse gods, Tyrbal introduces a **resilience layer** that auto-recovers from runtime errors. Whether it's an out-of-memory situation or a crash in an isolated thread, Tyrbal rolls back to a checkpoint or switches to a fallback path.

---

### 6. **Embedded Storytelling**

Tyrbal encourages developers to write code that tells a story. Use metadata annotations to embed comments, flow explanations, or debugging logs into a **narrative layer**. Perfect for team collaboration and project history.

```tyrbal
@story("This algorithm was inspired by a Viking ship's design.")
module VikingSort
  ...
end
```
